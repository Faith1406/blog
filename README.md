# Welcome to My Bloging space  

This is where I would try to post my whole week's experience with different projects that I am working on and many things I failed to make and learn.

This will not be a profecssional senior developer blog, that's why I choose github as the posting platform, by no means I am saying that github is an unprofessional or bad place to post a blog or any article, but I am saying that people might not even know about these post.

I will try to post in every week and also update this Readme.md file.

I am a studying computer science in college, I know, I know, took a really tuff decision even with those layoff news I keep hearing. 

What type of a blog it will be:
1. I wanted to do this to learn how to write markdown and get to spread the ups and downs I experienced during my learning and developing. 

1. I also thought if there something that I am doing completely wrong then there might be some advices. And that's all.

**Who I am**
Well that's the question you might be wondering if you didn't know me from before and stumble upon this.
So my name is **Aditya Naidu** aka **Taiyo**, like a metioned before I am currently studing **Computer Science** in a college, and for why I love programming is because, It's like I love my things, or more like the fact that I can make almost every thing I can *imagine* was wild to me so I started programming.

**Note for those who don't know me**
+ This is my first time write a blog or even any thing in general. So sorry in advance.
+ I hope even if you didn't learn any thing from these blogs that I will be posting, it will be a great learning sessionfrom my mistakes and I know I am going to make a lot of them. So I hope you still benefits from these blog even just a little bit.

**Note for those who know me**
+ First I don't know how you ended up here because I did'nt tell or posted anyone, this might be fate, hell nah. 
+ What I hope that you also might get something out of here. Even tho, you are better than me. **am I correct?**

Well if you want to connect or see what all shitty projects I made. You could go to the link below.
