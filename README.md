# Welcome to My Bloging space  

This is where i would try to post my whole week's expirience with different projects that I am working on and many things I failed to make and learn.

This will not be a profecssional senior developer blog, that's why i choose github as the posting platform, by no means I am saying that github is an unprofessional or bad place to post a blog or any article, but I am saying that people might not even know about these post.

I will try to post in every week and also update this Readme.md file.

I am a studying computer science in college, I know, I know, took a really tuff decision even with those layoff news I keep hearing. 

If for some reason you stumble upon this github repo and read the whole file, first I want to thank you for reading the whole thing, second how the hell it got to you I need to know. 

And also I am currently in a train travelling to the city where my college is so i will update this file definitly.



#Well, Thank You 
and #Good Bye
