## Starting the journey 

While I had the expirence what I thought, I am nowhere near to any mid software engineers.  
I didn't thought that I am good programmer but lets say I thought I am better at coding than half of the world.  
I was fooling myself as to why I don't know, I have never been a topper or felt like I am the best at anything when I was at school.  
But the thing was I was somewhat good at coding or I thought because I started coding before *2020* the infamous year when something big happen.  
Well my father said the computer programming field is the thing right now, and I was like why not take it.  
Let's say I was falling in love with programming because I could make something of my own.   
I followed many tutorials and then made an ai like siri but way worst, at that time there was no chatgpt or claude or it was like I didn't know if there was one.  
But still I copied word to word, letter to letter and it was very unstatisfactory. Still I showed that to my mother and other relative, they were somewhat impressed.  
But still I kept on going then I found out that I could make a game with programming, there was new joy in me to start making a game.  
And I started with *Unity*.  


## Tutorial Hell

The most unwanting thing that any programmer want, Well if you didn't knew it is a place where you just become a bot that just going from video to video, series to series.  
And I was also in that place it was, how do I say this miserable let's say I don't want to go to that place again.  
I was following tutorials one after other without any thought. It was really fraustating, I was thing I could not make anything from scratch.  
As to how I came out of it, well I don't know exactly but I could say the moment I realised that I could make any thing but would take time to build and that's okay, because it is the effort of learning that count.  
If you just go after one project to another thinking that it will make you feel like you are making progress but instead you should take   
it one by one if you want to make a game well choose 3d or 2d, most of us will say 3d in unity well learn only that part from the youtube and then add other special things that the tutorial is missing on your own then   
if that is also not clear search in google, try to search on your own from the documentation and at last if you could not find the solution then go search in the videos.


## Another Hell 


Well Tutorial Hell was a bad thing but this hell is even worst it is the AI prompting hell. even though you are a developer that solve problem you are making AI do that thing instead.  
I am current going through this and hopefull it will get any better in upcoming days. I complety stop using AI to ask question that are too simple and instead read article about it.  
Well I can't give you any other solution about this. but hopefully you are not trapped in this endless abyss.


## Rewind 

Let's stop the depressing talk and start the rewind of the week  what I did previous week, I shifted fully to neovim.  
Followed theprimeagen *Vim Rc* video and realised that the video is just outdated and now I followed his new not walk through but how to download or setup lazy vim.  
Remember what I said I didn't copy pasted the code and was done with it I actually learned about it and started with documentation of lazy vim  
and if I was stuck at something I went to his video and now I understand everything he is doing, now I have a personalized enviorement  
and that's all, you might be thinking is that it but it took me a week to figure out lazy vim and neovim now I could install any plugins I want  
and that's a win win for me. 


***Well, Thank You*** 
and ***Good Bye***
